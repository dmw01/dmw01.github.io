                    Our Senior Design Project will be based on developing a machine learning model that will be able to predict the creation and spread of wildfires.  Wildfires
                    can be destructive and difficult to prepare for as they appear suddenly and spread rapidly.  In California, the occurrence of wildfires are relatively frequent
                    due to the dry nature of the state.  By developing a machine learning model that can predict the creation and spread of wildfires, more people and their properties
                    will be safe from the early preparations.

                <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to <a href="https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20is%20an%20application,use%20it%20learn%20for%20themselves.">expert.ai</a>
                    machine learning is "an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
                    Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves."  In short, machine learning is an application of AI that uses
                    datasets to predict target outcomes on problems that would be difficult or nearly impossible otherwise.

                    Our project is divided into three major phases: Preparation, Model Building, and Quality Measurement as shown in Fig. 1.
                    The purpose of these three phases are to categorize each machine learning process into high-level chunks.  The major phases 
                    in machine learning are the data, model buidling, and the evaluation phase.

                    In machine learning, the data phase is the most crucial phase because machine learning models use the data to form predictions.
                    If the data is unusable or preprocessed incorrectly, the results will be inaccurate leading to an invalid project.  
                    In this project, the Preparation Phase handles all the data related tasks.  The high-level tasks are

                <p>
                    The modeling phase in machine learning is when the machine learning algorithms are applied on the preprocessed data.  In most cases, the algorithms are 
                    provided in various different API's and allows the users to import the packages, plug in the data, and use the algorithms with little effort.  The modeling 
                    phase takes three types of sub-datasets from the data preprocessed stage: train, validation, and test sub-datasets.  The models are trained using the
                    the train dataset, validated with the validation dataset, and tested using the test dataset.  The datasets used in the modeling phase are 
                    constructed using historical dataset, so the models can derived or recognize patterns within the datasets.  In our project, the machine learning
                    process is the same as the general stage.  We train, valid, and test the models using the three types of preprocessed datasets.

                <p>
                    The evaluation phase in machine learning is the stage when the prediction results from models, during the modeling phase, are compared to the 
                    actual dataset and evaluated for accuracy.  This is the phase when we explore the usability of the models.  There are a wide range of 
                    evaluation metrics that can be used that also depends on the type of problem being tackled (classification or regression).  In our project,
                    we will be using the classification metric, cross-validation and possibly regularization to validate and evaluation our models.
